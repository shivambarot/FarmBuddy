## Prototype Guide
Prototype Link: https://farmbuddy-app.herokuapp.com/

You can choose to register and log in as a customer or as a farmer. 

When you log in as a farmer, you can edit your store to add new items to your store and fill in specific information.

When you log in as a customer, you'll be taken to the Shop page, where you can buy as many items as you like and add them to your cart. After you decide what you want to buy, go to the shopping cart page checkout in the upper right corner, and select the delivery time after entering your address.
